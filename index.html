      <p>I'm grateful just to be safe right now. I'm kind of sad though, because some of my close family members passed away from Covid. I got my first vaccine recently,
      and I'll be getting my next one soon. I'm doing my bit to achieve herd immunity, so we can all see eachother's faces again.
      Anyways, I hope you (the person reading this) are doing well in these tough times, and if you aren't, I hope that everything get's better for you soon.</p>
